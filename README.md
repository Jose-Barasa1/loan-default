# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
Machine learning classification project to predict loan defaults for a microfinance institution.

## Business Understanding

**Stakeholder:** Risk Management Team at a Microfinance Institution

**Business Problem:** 
The institution experiences financial losses from loan defaults. They need to identify high-risk applicants before approving loans.

**Solution:**
Build a classification model to predict which loan applicants are likely to default, enabling the institution to:
- Adjust interest rates for high-risk borrowers
- Require additional collateral
- Make informed lending decisions
- Reduce financial losses

**Success Metrics:**
- Minimize false negatives (missing actual defaults)
- Balance precision and recall for business needs
